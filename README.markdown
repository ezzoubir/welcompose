## Suggested users ##

* Developers who creates CMS driven websites for their clients
* Designers who have a slightly knowledge of HTML/CSS but do not want to struggle with PHP
* Clients who have no HTML knowledge at all but want just take care of their website contents by themselves


## What Welcompose is \*not* ##

If you are lookin for a *click-to-go* solution with hundreds of plugins, predefined content or/and uneditable markup and WYSIWYG text editing, Welcompose might be not for you. The System provides a easy and flexible way to build websites, but does not (and don't want to) compare with complex Systems like Typo3, Drupal a.s.o.

The foremost goal was to give HTMl/CSS aware programmers and designers a way to build there own site structure without any intrusion of the CMS itself. No markup is predefined/printed at all. It all depends what the designer/programmer does within the templates.
