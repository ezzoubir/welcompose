## What Welcompose is \*not* ##

If you are lookin for a *click-to-go* solution with dozens of plugins, predefined content and WYSIWYG text editing, Welcompose might be not for you. The System provides a easy and flexible way to build websites, but does (and don't want to) compare with Systems like Typo3, Drupal a.so.
